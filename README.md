# Brick-Breaker
https://youtu.be/hzfpFEA6_rk

The Project is a Very Basic remake of the game Brick Breaker. It combines the knowledge of both Mario and Pong into one game

For the Bricks i created a table called bricks in which each element is another table/object (called brick) having their initial coordinates and dimensions as characteristics

The Ball and the Paddle are identical to those in Pong

Upon collision , the bricks are removed from the list and also from the screen. When the list becomes empty, You win or if all lives are lost, You lose.
